<h3>I received this card</h3>
If you can see it in your storage, probably you will sync with me in some time ❤️<br>
Just continue using network and download more cards to speed up your connection.<br>
You should try to search for some card aggregator (like popular users), who will provide more cards for you.<br>
</div>

<div class="column">
<h3>I possess this card</h3>
You can customize this template in Leek/businesscard.html file<br>
You may add here come contact info or redesign.<br>
After you start Leek clinet, your signed card will appear in storage<br>
If you want people to know about you - just give this file them (they should copy it into their storages)<br>
