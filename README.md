<div class="column"><br><h3>What a?</h3><a href="https://github.com/CodeDruidX/LeekPeer">LeekPeer</a> - <i>Leek P2P endpoint ed25519 rig</i>, making the overlay P2P intelligence as simple as python script.<h3>How it?</h3>Nodes like you are trackers and clients at the same time!<br>The first and powerful rule in our network - Everybody does what they want!<br>Network is truly anon, but every article you share is safely signed by your very-very private key - so your .onion nickname will be the owner of this file forever.<h3>Zen?</h3>
<i>There is no way to break our union, since it is absolutely decentralized and continue its work in offline</i><br>
And the second sounds like "No <b>outcoming</b> connections - only <b>incoming</b>"
So, the master concept is: share all, but take only that you really keen on.<br>
Nobody will be able to read your <b>first</b> article before you share it manually, but if you were flashed in someone database - distribution speed of your article will be exponential related with amount of your articles settled in the Leek network.
